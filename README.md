# ENDURA — Dual Identity Commerce Platform

ENDURA is a premium fashion commerce platform built around the philosophy of **dual identity** — where every physical garment is paired with a corresponding digital collectible.  
The platform blends storytelling, commerce, and technology to create an exclusive, cinematic brand experience.

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of the ENDURA platform, including the customer-facing website, digital vault, and administrative systems.

## 🌑 Brand Concept

In a world split between physical reality and the digital universe, ENDURA designs clothing for both.

Each product exists twice:
- **IRL Clothing** — the physical garment
- **URL Clothing** — a digital twin collectible

Purchasing an ENDURA product unlocks access to its digital counterpart, reinforcing the idea that identity is no longer single-dimensional.

ENDURA is positioned as an **Order**, not just a brand.

# Contributing to ENDURA

Thank you for being part of the Order. To ensure project integrity and code quality, please follow these guidelines.

## Development Workflow
1. **Branching Strategy**: Use `feat/`, `fix/`, or `docs/` prefixes for branches.
2. **Commit Messages**: Be clear and descriptive (e.g., `feat: implement user authentication`).
3. **Coding Standards**: Follow the existing ESLint and formatting rules.

## Pull Request Process
1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Ensure all tests pass.
3. Submit a PR with a clear description of changes.
4. Merge only after approval.

## Security First
Never commit secrets or `.env` files. Ensure all new API endpoints are protected where necessary.
